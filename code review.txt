Code review notes:

- some of the names not too clear (currentState, changed it to board)
- Game.js has too many responsibilities:
    - saving/loading the board
    - handling both board update and drawing the cell when a cell is toggled
    - dealing with the worker


Some ideas:
- create a separate class for the board
- don't let the cell find out it's neighbours, the board should do that
- drop the worker idea (it failed to work on my chrome)
